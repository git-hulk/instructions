- Use // for comments; /* ... */ is allowed but less common. Be consistent within a file.
- Every file should start with license boilerplate.
- File-level comments should describe the purpose and contents of the file.
- Every non-obvious class or struct should have a comment describing its purpose and usage.
- Almost every function declaration should have a comment describing what it does and how to use it. Focus on inputs, outputs, and ownership/lifetime of arguments.
- Comment tricky or non-obvious code blocks to explain why, not just what, the code does.
- Use complete sentences, proper punctuation, and correct grammar in comments.
- Use TODO comments for temporary or incomplete code, including an identifier (e.g., TODO(username): ...).
- Do not state the obvious; prefer self-documenting code.
