- Each indentation level must be 4 spaces.
- The maximum line width is 100 characters.
- Prefer block indent over visual indent for function calls and similar constructs.
- Use trailing commas in comma-separated lists when followed by a newline.
- Separate items and statements by zero or one blank line (one or two newlines).
- Sort items using version-sorting where specified.
- Use rustfmt with default settings to ensure community-consistent formatting.
- For small items (e.g., struct literals), single-line formatting is allowed if the item is simple and short.
- Limit source lines that are entirely comments to 80 characters, or the maximum line width including indentation, whichever is smaller.
